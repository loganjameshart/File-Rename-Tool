# File Rename Tool
Scrapes an inputted Substack newsletter page and outputs to a Word doc. 

## How It's Made:

Python Standard Library.

I made this to automate a mundane work task of rename a very large group of files in a folder using a CSV with two columns. The first column should contain the original file names (you can copy/paste directly from the file explorer), and the second name contains what the files will be renamed to. It's a 1-to-1 renaming--file in Column A will be renamed to the text in Column B in the same row.
